# Deep Facial Phenotyping for Genetic Disorder Verification using ArcFace Model

1.	## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Deep Facial Phenotyping** for **Genetic Disorder Verification** using the **ArcFace Model**. The goal of the project is to predict genetic disorders based on facial features using facial recognition techniques. The model utilizes pre-trained ArcFace models, fine-tuned on the Gestalt Matcher database, to compare facial images and make predictions regarding genetic disorders.
2.	## Requirements
To run this project, you will need:
- **Google Colab** environment or any compatible Python environment.
- **Gestalt Matcher Database**: This dataset is not publicly available. You must request access from the official website of Gestalt Matcher.
- **ArcFace Models**: Two models, **ArcFace50** and **ArcFace100**, are required. These can be downloaded from the [InsightFace GitHub Repository](https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/model_zoo).
- **Necessary Libraries**: Ensure that all required libraries are installed in your environment.
·	### Required Libraries:
1. `Flask`
2. `torch`
3. `numpy`
4. `pandas`
5. `albumentations`
6. `opencv-python`
7. `onnx2torch`
8. `pyngrok`
3.	These libraries can be installed using `pip`. You can install them by running the following command in the Google Colab environment:
4.	```python
	!pip install flask torch numpy pandas albumentations opencv-python onnx2torch pyngrok

Setup and Execution
Clone this repository: You can either download the notebook or clone the repository if it is hosted on GitHub.
Download ArcFace Models:
·	Download ArcFace50 and ArcFace100 models pretrained on Glint360K from the https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/model_zoo.
·	Save these models in the saved_models/ directory.
Gestalt Matcher Database:
·	Request the Gestalt Matcher database from the official website. The dataset is required for generating encodings and making predictions.
·	After receiving the dataset, specify the path to the Gestalt Matcher database in the corresponding part of the code.
Upload the Project Notebook: The entire project is contained in a single Google Colab notebook. Upload the notebook to your Google Colab environment.
Run the Code: Follow these steps in the notebook:
·	Mount Google Drive to access the dataset (if using Google Colab).
·	Provide the correct path to the Gestalt Matcher Database.
·	Ensure the ArcFace50 and ArcFace100 models are in the saved_models/ directory.
·	Run each code block sequentially to set up the models and prepare the system for predictions.
Prediction: After setting up the models, you can upload a facial image through a Flask web interface, which will provide the top 10 predicted genetic disorders with their similarity scores.

Model Details
•	The project uses ArcFace, a state-of-the-art face recognition model, to extract features from images. The models are fine-tuned with the Gestalt Matcher database.
•	For these also require the pretrained ArcFace models from insightface: glint360k_r50.onnx and glint360k_r100.onnx to be in the directory ./saved_models.These models can be downloaded from the https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface/tree/master/model_zoo.
•	The predictions are generated by comparing the uploaded image to stored encodings in the dataset.
Folder Structure
Here’s an overview of the folder structure:
•	saved_models/: Contains pre-trained ArcFace50 and ArcFace100 models.
•	data/: Contains the Gestalt Matcher database (path should be provided).
•	uploaded_image.jpg: The image that the user uploads for prediction.
Web Interface
•	A simple Flask web interface is included for easy interaction:
•	The user can upload an image of a face.
•	The model will return the top 10 predicted genetic disorders with their similarity scores.

Notes:
•	Make sure that the Gestalt Matcher Database and ArcFace Models are properly loaded in your environment before running the code.
•	You may need to request additional permissions for using the Gestalt Matcher database, as it is restricted.
